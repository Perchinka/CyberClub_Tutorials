<p align="center">Tutorials for CyberSecurity club at <b>Chesterton Comunity College</b> 2023.</p>

I used [Manim](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) for this project

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Perchinka/CyberClub_Tutorials.git
cd CyberClub_Tutorials
poetry install
```

And also you need to install [Manim's dependencies](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/linux.html#required-dependencies) to render tutorials localy


# Usage
You can find all rendered presentations at the http://alex.lukin.family/tutorials (Not yet)


If you are rendering it localy:
```
cd *TutorialFolder*
manim main.py -qh
manim-slides Tutorial
```
